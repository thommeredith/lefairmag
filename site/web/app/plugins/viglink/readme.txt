The easiest way to monetize your content, VigLink pays you when visitors buy the brands and products you write about.

== Description ==
We believe making money from blogging shouldn't take more time than, well, blogging.  VigLink automatically pays you when people buy the brands and products you write about.

You’ve put time, creativity, and money into building your own brand and cultivating loyal followers who share your viewpoints, trust your recommendations, and find inspiration in your writing. As your audience visits your site in a shopping frame of mind, you deserve to earn revenue from the purchases you drive. VigLink makes this possible.

By [signing up for VigLink](https://publishers.viglink.com/sign-up) and installing this plugin, you can automatically monetize links to over 30,000 cooperating merchants. [VigLink Convert](https://www.viglink.com/publisher-content-monetization/#convert-tab-content), our product that converts ordinary links into monetized links, works on existing links across all of your pages. It even works for links distributed in your RSS feeds.

After you’ve signed up, sign in to [viglink.com](https://sessions.viglink.com/sign-in) to check your dashboard where we provide reports for all the clicks leaving your site (data Google Analytics does not offer), giving you insight into where your readers are going, what links are most lucrative, what pages or posts earn the most, and what products people are buying.

VigLink keeps a percentage of the revenue we earn for you, so there is no risk. For VigLink Convert, we keep 25% and pay you 75%. Existing affiliate links are not touched and you benefit from the maximum compensation possible for your traffic. After all, with tens of thousands of sites like yours in our network, we can negotiate directly with the retailers to secure the very best payouts.

When clicks leave your site, you are creating value. VigLink is the easiest and most complete way to measure and capture that value.
