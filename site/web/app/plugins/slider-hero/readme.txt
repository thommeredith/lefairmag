= Why Use Slider Hero Rather than Other WordPress Slider Plugin? =

Traditional Image Sliders are bad for user conversions and they cause <strong>banner blindness</strong>. They are boring and do not engage users. Eye tracking studies conducted by Neilson Norman Group found that as soon as visitors perceived something to be an advertisement they turned their focus away from it. Image sliders divide your user’s attention. Images on slides represent different products or offers in the span of a few seconds. Your website user has hardly read a single thing when whoosh...the image changes and they have to refocus their attention. 

Our slider plugin is different. It <strong>focuses on your core messages/<strong>, uses a background animation of your choice to keep the user <strong>interested and focused</strong>. The unique Call to Action button leads the users where they really need to be. The effects are almost like subtle Cinemagraph animations when used in onjunction with your images or text carousels. Think of it as a perfect alternative to background videos.


= More than a Slider Plugin - Use Motion Typography to Build Amazing Product Intros = 

The other unique feature of Slider Hero is the Intro Advert builder. Introduce your products and services with a <strong>dramatic flair</strong>. The typographic intro builder allows you to do something very unique. You can create stunning product introductions like stunning “Apple – iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in 107 seconds” or “Introducing Pixel, Phone by Google” with chained text animation combining background audio of your choice.

Build a combination of beautiful text animation along with the background animation. This can be applied in company  introductions, creative projects, for your product or service launch etc. You can easily change the color of the text, animation type and more! The intro builder interface is simple and intuitive.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I remove ‘watch later’, ‘share’ and channel ‘subscribe’ buttons =
Unfortunately, since September 2018 there is no option to hide Watch Later, Share and Video Title within embedded YouTube iframe. Simply, YouTube does not allow anymore ‘clean’ embed without those components.

However, the [Slider Hero Pro](https://www.quantumcloud.com/products/slider-hero) version supports an overlay technique to mitigate these.

= Does Slider Hero Support Youtube Background Video Auto Play? =
Video will auto play if it does not have sound. You can turn off the sound setting from the Video settings. If video has sound then it depends on the browser policy and the user's history with your website. Please check this article from Google for more details:
https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes

Some effects simply does not support background image because background image will look extremely odd with those selected effects. That is why your background image is not showing up with those few selected effects.
