## THIRSTYAFFILIATES 💥

***ThirstyAffiliates*** gives bloggers the tools they need to monetize their WordPress website with affiliate marketing.

We’ve made managing your affiliate links as simple as it should be:

1. Install & activate the ThirstyAffiliates plugin
1. Go to Affiliate Links -> Add New
1. Enter the destination URL (your affiliate link) and a title
1. The plugin creates a new shortlink/link redirect to your long ugly affiliate link by making a pretty link with your own website URL
1. You can then use the new “TA” button in your editor to add your affiliate link to your content easily

eg. http://example.com/recommends/some-product

## Features ✔️

**💡 SIMPLE**
No complex setups. It’s just another post type in your admin and another button on your Visual editor.

When you are writing blog posts, you can highlight a word and click the “TA” button. This works just like the built-in link tool, you can search for the affiliate link you created earlier by name.

You can even use the Quick Add button to add affiliate links to ThirstyAffiliates on the fly while you are writing.

**🔗 BUILT-IN AFFILIATE LINK SHORTNER/LINK CLOAKER**
Create pretty links from the affiliate links you've placed on the site. ThirstyAffiliates will use a /recommends/ prefix by default for your pretty links, but this can be easily changed to match your preferences.

**💰 SEAMLESS STRIPE SALES***
Create a branded, one-click path to payment with NEW ThirstyPay™ Links. Share your link and start selling anywhere – instantly.

**⚙️ BETTER LINK MANAGEMENT**
You can group your affiliate links into hierarchical categories. eg. placing all Amazon links within an “Amazon” category, or all software links in a “Software” category.

Managing your links in ThirstyAffiliates means there is only one place to change the destination URL if required rather than having to go back and replace the link in potentially hundreds of articles.

**🔃 SAFE REDIRECTS & SMART UNCLOAKING**
You can choose from 301 (default), 302, or 307 redirects, all of which are safe link redirects.

Link redirects protect your affiliate links from being scraped and replaced by malware in your visitor’s browser.

There is also a smart uncloaking feature so if the affiliate program you are using (such as Amazon Associates) does not like your links behind a redirect, you can still use ThirstyAffiliates. Your links can be conditionally uncloaked on the front end.

**🛡️ NO LINK CLASHES OR DATABASE BLOAT**
Uses proper custom post types to avoid link clashes that can occur with other solutions.

Keeps its database footprint small to ensure you don’t over bloat your database with useless information.

**🖼️ ADD IMAGES TO AFFILIATE LINKS**
You can even add images and banners to your affiliate links and recall them for easy insertion when writing your content.

Simply click the new “TA” affiliate link button on your editor, click the cog to open the Advanced Link Picker, and search & choose the image you want to insert and it will be inserted pre-wrapped in your affiliate link.

**📊 CLICK STATISTICS & REPORTS**
Adds click tracking to your links to track every click.

Comes with built-in reports so you can explore, over time, how much your affiliate links have been clicked and what is popular on your site.

... and so much more! Visit [our site](https://thirstyaffiliates.com/) to learn more about what ThirstyAffiliates can do for you.

\* Pro users benefit from no added payment processing fees, while a small 3% fee is added per-transaction for free users.
